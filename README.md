Wordpress Groovy RPC Lib
=============================

Description
-----------
A Groovy utility to interact with the WordPress XML-RPC API.
It covers all services described at http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_WordPress_API.

See test package as a reference for usage.

TODO
----
This library was built for old site migration to Wordpress primarily,
so some API has not been tested well, but it's ongoing.
